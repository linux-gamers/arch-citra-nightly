# arch-citra-nightly

This repository stores the Citra emulator [nightly branch](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly) release binaries generated from an Arch Linux based Docker image ([DockerFile](https://github.com/linux-gamers/arch-citra-nightly/blob/master/Dockerfile)). In the future we aim to provide automated releases (also for AUR ->  at the moment the releases are published by hand).

It is not affiliated with the offical development team, and the [official project's license](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly/blob/master/license.txt) should be respected.

Failed release builds are written to [builds_failed.txt](https://github.com/linux-gamers/arch-citra-nightly/blob/master/builds_failed.txt).
